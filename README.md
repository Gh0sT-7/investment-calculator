# Investment Calculator ðŸ“ˆ

- ðŸ“˜ A small investment calculator to help produce some quick numbers to help with asset analysis.

# Usage
```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## How it works? ðŸš€
- 1) Add your initial starting capital in the **Initial Investment** field.
- 2) Add the amount you'll continually invest in the **Annual Investment** field.
- 3) Average out the assumed return in **Expected Return**.
- 4) Finally, dertermine the length of time you will hold this investment with the **Duration**.

This will then show you the the value of your investment each year, the interest it attracted based on the **Expected Return** and the total intrest from the range of each previous year. This also includes the amount invested at the end of each year taking into account your initial investment.

ðŸŽ¯ **Note: this is for making very rough analysis and will still require further due dilligence on the asset or security you're interested in.
